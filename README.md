# Health Care Data Patient Wait List Power BI data analysis

## Project Goals:
#### Track current status of patient waiting list:
  * Understand the real-time status of patients currently waiting for medical services.
#### Analyze historical monthly trend of waiting list in Inpatient & Outpatient categories:
  * Examine how the patient waiting list has changed over time on a monthly basis, specifically distinguishing between Inpatient and Outpatient categories.
#### Detailed specialty level & age profile analysis:
  * Conduct a detailed analysis to understand the distribution of patients on the waiting list based on medical specialties and age groups.

## Data Scope:
  * The time period for which you are collecting and analyzing data is from 2018 to 2021.

### Metrics Required:

#### Average & Median Waiting List:
  * Calculate the mean (average) and median of the patient waiting list to understand the central tendency of the data.
#### Current Total Wait List:
  * Determine the total number of patients currently on the waiting list.

## Views Required:

#### Summary Page:
  * Provide an overview of key metrics and high-level insights for quick reference.

#### Detailed Page for Granular Analysis:
